What's New
- Enchanting overhaul! Craft new bookshelves, construct altars and discover tomes to manipulate the different enchanting attributes and control your pool of enchantments - and use the table on the same item multiple times! I've reimagined the entire enchanting system & most related mechanics
- Useful Anvils - once again can you combine enchanted equipment as you desire, with new experience costs and no too expensive :)
- Blessings, Enchantments, Curses - featuring dozens of new & reworked enchantments, curses and the all-new blessings (which can be acquired when using tomes at your enchanting table)
- Performance & visual improvements! Less stutter, higher framerates, and additional visual effects ensure an improved experience for all systems thanks to modlist changes & shader tweaks
